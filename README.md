# relativistic-addition
A Manim project for the relativistic addition of velocity.

# Requisites
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (latest version)
- [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) (latest version)
- [FFmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)
- [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) 

# Run
If you have every requisite listed above (on Windows, you must have everything added to `PATH`), by calling

```sh
manim video.py [SCENE NAME]
```

you should be able to generate every scene of the script.

**Note**: if you didn't clone the repository, you must put `video.py` into a folder, and execute the command above from inside this folder (Manim generates animations under the specified folder).
