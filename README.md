# relativistic-addition
A Manim project for the relativistic addition of velocity.

# Requisites
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (latest version)

# Running
If you have every requisite listed above (on Windows, you must have everything added to `PATH`), by calling

```sh
manim video.py [SCENE NAME]
```

you should be able to generate every scene of the script one by one, or if you prefer

```sh
manim video.py -a
```

allows you to create every scene with one command.
